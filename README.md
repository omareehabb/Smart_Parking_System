🚗 Smart Parking System 🅿️
A smart garage solution that automates car counting and gate control using FPGA (implemented in VHDL with Quartus Prime⚡).

🌟 Features:
      🔄 Automatic Gate Control: Gate opens via push button (simulating an operator)
      🔍 Car Detection: IR sensor detects vehicles passing through
      🧮 Car Counter: Tracks total cars entering (displayed on 7-segment display)
      ⚙️ Actuator Integration: Gate closes automatically after car entry

🛠️ Hardware & Tools
      FPGA Board 
      7-Segment Display (car count visualization)
      IR Sensor (car detection)
      Servo Motor/Actuator (gate control)
      Quartus Prime (VHDL design & synthesis)

💡 Why It’s Cool?
      Real-world automation with minimal human intervention.
      Scalable for multi-level parking systems.
      Low-power FPGA implementation.
